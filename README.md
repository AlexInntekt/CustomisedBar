# CustomisedBar

     The default tabBar offered in xCode is easy to use but might lack some flexibility when a different graphics approach is needed.

     This app presents a customized tabBar with an interesting implementation and functionality. The design possibilities are unlimited.

     Structure:   
  -The important data is declared and used globally.  
  -A main viewController is displayed and contains the tabBar and a UIView (called contentView) is used as a content view for 
displaying the content of the other view controllers. 
  -It contains three buttons, connected with code with an array of buttons. When one of them is tapped, the content of the 
linked viewController, with respect of the index, is displayed in the main ViewController.
  -Structure made from scratch.  
  -It looks nice
